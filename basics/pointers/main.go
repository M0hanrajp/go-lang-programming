/* Pointers */
// Variables are the names given to a memory location where the actual data is stored.
// To access the stored data we need the address of that particular memory location.
/* To remember all the memory addresses(Hexadecimal Format) manually is an overhead thatâ€™s
   why we use variables to store data and variables can be accessed just by using their name. */

/* A pointer is a special kind of variable that is not only used to store the memory addresses of other variables but
   also points where the memory is located and provides ways to find out the value stored at that memory location. */
